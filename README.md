# RobotArm
This is a project of my that i created as a software to run a simple robot arm. Arm uses 3 stepper motors for axis control and a servo motor for griper control. i used shift register for more inputs, joystick for up-down and forward-backward controls. Gripper is controled with two buttons.

## Library's used
- Stepper.h
- Arduino.h
- Servo.h

Project is was created with platformIO which is a vscode extension which allows you to create arduino based projects in vscode enviorment.  

## Parts list 
- 3 stepper motors 28byj48 with ULN2003 driver board
- 9g servo
- Sift register 74HC595 
- Arduino Uno
- 4 buttons
- 1 joystick
- Some resistors
# Still in development
